### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m an ambitious third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, originally from Pakistan and now a proud resident of Canada 🇨🇦. My journey in software engineering has been fueled by a passion for learning, problem-solving, and contributing to impactful projects. Since arriving in Canada in August 2022, I've immersed myself in the field and am continuously working on projects that build my skills and broaden my experience.

I'm actively looking for internship opportunities across Canada and the US to further apply my knowledge in real-world settings, and to make a positive impression on future employers through a well-rounded GitHub profile.

- **Flight Management Program**: A program that helps in managing various aspects of flight operations, part of my undergraduate course projects.
